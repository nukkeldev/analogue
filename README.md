## What is Analogue?

The **Analogue** project encompasses two primary components: the **Generator** and the closely-tied **Editor**.

### Generator

The **Analogue Generator** is a parser generator that converts `.ana` files into generated implementations for supported backends.

### Editor

The **Analogue Editor** is a node-based graph editor to describe `.ana` parsing graphs, later to be fed into the **Generator**, with an emphasis on UX/DX.

## Features

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) until some features are stabilized.
